# Gnar-game
A little game I'm making where you adventure into the unknown! Very much still a work in progress.
So far: The player can move around, interact with the NPCs, and complete a simple quest with branch choices. 
There is also an inventory and list of quests that are updated by the actions of the player. 

Commands: 
1. mov {up, down, left, right} --- move the character 
2. questlist --- opens up a list of current quests
3. inventory --- opens up a list of items in your inventory

1/22/2019 update:
Finished Cat quest, debugged dialogue.
Quest engine is pretty much finished.
